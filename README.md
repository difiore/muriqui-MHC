# muriqui-MHC

This repository contains data and code used for the analyses presented in "Paternity data reveal high MHC diversity in a polygynandrous, egalitarian primate" (Chaves, Strier, and Di Fiore, under review).

The RMarkdown document "Muriqui MHC Analyses.Rmd" includes code to:
- read genotype data and construct matrices of estimated dyadic relatedness among pairs of either adult or all individuals in the population
- read MHC variation data for each individual
- construct matrices of female-male allele sharing, male allelic diversity, female-male allele dissimilarity, male allelic uniqueness, and female- male relatedness between dams and potential sires of those dams offspring
- and conduct genetic simulations to test predictions outlined in the manuscript about the relationship between patterns of parentage and MHC and neutral genetic variation among dams and sires
